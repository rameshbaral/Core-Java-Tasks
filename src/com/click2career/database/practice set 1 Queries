--1 How can you produce a list of facilities, with each labeled as 'cheap' or 'expensive' depending on if
-- their monthly maintenance cost is more than $100? Return the name and monthly maintenance of
-- the facilities in question.

select name,
       case when (monthlymaintenance > 100) then
                'expensive'
            else
                'cheap'
           end as cost
from facilities;
--2  How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?

select * from facilities where name like '%Tennis%'

-- 3 How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR
-- operator.

SELECT * FROM facilities WHERE facid IN (1,5);

-- 4. How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named â€˜xyz'?
SELECT a.starttime
FROM bookings AS a
INNER JOIN members AS b ON a.memid = b.memid
WHERE b.firstname = 'xyz';

--5. How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-
--   21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.

SELECT a.starttime AS start, b.name
FROM bookings AS a
INNER JOIN facilities AS b ON a.facid = b.facid
WHERE b.name LIKE 'Tennis Court%'
AND date(a.starttime) = '2012-09-21'
ORDER BY  a.starttime;

-- 6 How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member? Ensure that
--  there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).

SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname, m.surname
FROM members AS m1
INNER JOIN members AS m ON (m.memid = m1.recommendedby)
ORDER BY m.surname, m.firstname;

--7. How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if
--   any)? Ensure that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).

SELECT m.firstname, m.surname, r.firstname, r.surname
FROM members AS m
LEFT OUTER JOIN members AS r ON (m.recommendedby = r.memid)
ORDER BY m.surname, m.firstname;

--8. How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court? Include in your output
--   the name of the court, and the name of the member formatted as a single column. Ensure no
--  duplicate data, and order by the member name followed by the facility name.

SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member, f.name AS facility
FROM members AS m
INNER JOIN bookings AS b ON (m.memid = b.memid)
INNER JOIN facilities AS f ON (b.facid = f.facid)
WHERE f.name LIKE 'Tennis%'
ORDER BY member, facility;

--9. How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or
--   guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are
--   per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility,
---  the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost, and
--  do not use any subqueries.

SELECT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member_fullname,
       f.name AS facility_booked,
       (CASE WHEN m.memid = 0 THEN f.guestcost * b.slots
             ELSE f.membercost * b.slots END) AS total_cost
FROM members AS m
         INNER JOIN bookings AS b ON (m.memid = b.memid)
         INNER JOIN facilities AS f ON (b.facid = f.facid)
WHERE (date_trunc('day', b.starttime) = '2012-09-14') AND
    ((m.memid = 0 AND b.slots * f.guestcost > 30) OR
     (m.memid > 0 AND b.slots * f.membercost > 30))
ORDER BY cost DESC;

-- 10. How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.

SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member,
                (SELECT r.firstname || ' ' || r.surname
                 FROM members AS r
                 WHERE m.recommendedby = r.memid) AS recommended_by
FROM members AS m ORDER BY member;

-- 11. For our first foray into aggregates, we're going to stick to something simple. We want to know
-- how many facilities exist - simply produce a total count.

SELECT COUNT(facid) FROM facilities;

--12. Produce a count of the number of facilities that have a cost to guests of 10 or more.

SELECT COUNT(facid) FROM facilities WHERE guestcost >= 10

-- 13. Produce a count of the number of recommendations each member has made. Order by member ID.

SELECT recommendedby, COUNT(memid) FROM members
WHERE recommendedby IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY recommendedby
ORDER BY recommendedby
